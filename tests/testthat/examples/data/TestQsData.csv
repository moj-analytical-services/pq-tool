Central","28/10/14","<p>The Ministry of Justice provides grant funding to Victim Support to help witnesses at both the Crown Court and magistratesŠ—È courts in England and Wales. The service provides information, emotional and practical support to witnesses who are attending court to give evidence. This is a vital part of our commitment to victims and witnesses.</p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Justice does not routinely collect data on the number of staff deployed to each court by Victim Support. Victim Support has provided the following breakdown of staff deployed at each Crown Court location for each year since 2010 and includes Victim SupportŠ—Ès assessment of their Full Time Equivalent apportionment. Some staff are deployed full-time at the Crown Court, while others provide support at Crown Court alongside some apportionment of their time for other local witness and victim services. Approximately 200,000 witnesses received support from the court-based Witness Service in 2013-14. The number of Victim Support staff deployed to each court has remained broadly consistent over the last four years.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to the court-based Witness Service, victims and witnesses also receive support from Witness Care Units (jointly staffed by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service).

As with all HR databases, extracts are taken at a fixed point in time to ensure consistency of reporting. Rounding to 10 accurately depicts the level of certainty with which information is held. However, it does mean that the level of shortfalls presented here is the difference of the benchmark to the rounded staff numbers and will therefore differ slightly from the unrounded figures which are used internally.</p>","Selous, Andrew","05/11/14","Labour","Khan, Sadiq","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many prison officer vacancies at each grade there were in each prison in each month since January 2014.","Tooting","31/10/14","<p>Prison Officer vacancies are defined as a deficit of staff in post compared to benchmark staffing level.

As with all HR databases, extracts are taken at a fixed point in time to ensure consistency of reporting. Rounding to 10 accurately depicts the level of certainty with which information is held. However, it does mean that the level of shortfalls presented here is the difference of the benchmark to the rounded staff numbers and will therefore differ slightly from the unrounded figures which are used internally.</p>","Selous, Andrew","Labour"

activity vary between sites. This variation is influenced by a number of factors, chiefly by the category and role of the prison and the types of prisoner available to work. For example the transient nature of the prisoner population in local establishments, as well as the requirements of commercial customers, mean that this is a more challenging, and often less suitable environment into which to introduce work.</p><p> </p><p>The physical capacity of prisons Š—– primarily available space and operating environment Š—– is an additional limiting factor. Many prisoners were built without large work shops.</p><p> </p><p>These differences in capacity and capability are reflected in prison Service Level Agreements and in the performance framework; establishments with higher capacity and capability to deliver industrial activity will have higher target hours and this will carry a higher weighting in the prison rating system than for establishments with lower levels of capacity.</p><p> </p><p>The regime in prisons is changing for convicted prisoners as NOMS implements the benchmark core day and the opportunities it provides to extend the working day as well as the potential to increase time in other activities including education.

This variation is influenced by a number of factors, chiefly by the category and role of the prison and the types of prisoner available to work.

"279","Davies, Philip","To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what proportion of all recalls to prison have been fixed term recalls in each year since their introduction.","214735","Shipley","17/11/14","<p /> <p>A fixed-term recall is one where an offender on licence is recalled for a 28 day period before being automatically re-released. It is available only to those offenders on licence who are not assessed as presenting a high risk of harm to the public. Offenders who are assessed as presenting a high risk of harm are not eligible to receive a fixed-term recall and will be given a standard recall, under which they can remain in custody, potentially, until the end of their sentence. They will be released before the end of their sentence only if the Parole Board or Secretary of State is satisfied they no longer need to be detained to protect the public.</p><p> </p><p>The statutory provisions for fixed-term recalls were included in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 and commenced in July 2008. The provisions were amended by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 and commenced in December 2012. The amendments were designed to provide offender managers with additional flexibility to determine whether a fixed-term recall was the appropriate way to respond to an offenderŠ—Ès breach of his licence conditions, notwithstanding that he had been given a fixed-term recall on a previous occasion.</p><p> </p><p>This Government is introducing a new test, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which must be applied to determine the type of recall given to an offender and to decide whether to re-release a recalled offender.

The department has also put in place a block on Government Procurement Cards, preventing payments to bars and restaurants.</p><p /> <p /><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=""3""><p><ins class=""ministerial""><strong>MoJ core and Agency spend on Hospitality and related catering since April 2008:</strong></ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""><strong> </strong></ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""><strong> </strong></ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""><strong> </strong></ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""><strong> </strong></ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""><strong> </strong></ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""><strong> </strong></ins></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">MoJ HQ</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">Nac Level 6</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">FY08/09</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">FY09/10</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">FY10/11</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">FY11/12</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">FY12/13</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">FY13/14</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">FY14/15 to end Oct-14</ins></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">224226-Entertainment</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">3,773.76</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">0.00</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">585.29</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">327.90</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">326.40</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">60.00</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">252.52</ins></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">224227-Hospitality</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">18,572.77</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">18,755.64</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">6,584.20</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">3,095.97</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">2,893.31</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">1,312.56</ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">745.45</ins></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><ins class=""ministerial""> </ins></p></td><td><p><ins class=""ministerial"">224228-External Lunches &amp;

The campaign went live on 2 January 2015 and includes online advertising, Google key word searches and Google Display adverts that direct people to the Family Mediation Council website and in particular, the find your local mediator tool. Other initiatives included a sponsored Q&amp;A discussion on Mumsnet as well as a social media campaign and media relations in the consumer media. This has resulted in a 320% increase in visitors to the FMC website in the first two months of the year as of 28 February this year compared to the last six months of 2014. The campaign runs until 20 March.</p><p> </p><p>To support the mediation profession, with MoJ assistance and guidance, the Family Mediation Council introduced a new Professional Standards Framework from 1 January 2015. This will provide the basis for a much needed consistent approach in how mediators should operate. It will allow the general public - the clients of mediation Š—– to be confident in the service that is being provided; they will know what it means to go to mediation; they will understand that mediators are to be trusted as properly trained and accredited practitioners; and most importantly, they will know they are protected by a properly regulated profession.</p><p> </p><p>More widely, the Government actively encourages mediation in civil litigation cases through its support of the small-claims mediation service, and the mediation referral website. Signposting literature in the Courts, various provisions in the Civil Procedure Rules and the numerous pre-action protocols promote this. In addition the MoJ has received the Civil Justice CouncilŠ—Ès report on Online Dispute Resolution for Low Value Civil Claims, and will respond in due course.</p>","Hughes, Simon","Not found"
